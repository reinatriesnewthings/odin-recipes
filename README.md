# odin-recipes
This is the "Recipes" project from The Odin Project. In this project, I built a basic recipe website. The website has a main index page which has links to a few different pages with different recipes.
Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to create a website, link to other pages and images within a website, and write ordered and unordered lists using HTML.
